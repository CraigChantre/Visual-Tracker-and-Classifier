# Visual-Tracker-and-Classifier
Visual Tracker and Classifier Using Linear Regression

This project implements a Visual Tracker and Classifier leveraging linear regression techniques. The system is designed to identify and track objects within a video stream, classifying them based on their visual features.
Features

    Real-time Object Tracking: Efficiently track objects within video frames using a robust tracking algorithm.
    
    Object Classification: Classify tracked objects into predefined categories using linear regression.
    
    Grayscale Conversion: Convert video frames to grayscale to simplify processing and improve performance.
    
    Edge Detection: Utilize edge detection techniques to enhance object recognition.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    sh

    git clone https://github.com/CraigChantre/visual-tracker-classifier.git
    cd visual-tracker-classifier

Install the required dependencies:

    sh

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Run the main script to start the tracker and classifier:

    sh

    python main.py

    Ensure your webcam is connected, or modify the script to use a video file.
